# IMPORTANT NOTE

I have discussed this idea/issue with Jay, Dipesh & Edwin. My program/code has a few hard coded variables i.e. customer in many of my functions. This is in order to correctly identify the data read/posted from EasyTables.

My user scenario is of a logged-in user. An existing customer (of Contoso Bank) who logs into the customer portal and is interacting with the bot/assistant. The user would be authenticated into the system and the bot should be able to retrieve the relevant details. Hence it would not require the chat bot to ask the user for the credentials or any identity verfication upon first interaction and throughout the use of features. 

As adviced by Dipesh. The user authentication would be done through the customer portal login, through which the credentials will be stored and matched in the backend (EasyTables) which the bot can use to validate and identify the active user. Due to time constraints I was not able to implement all the requirements of this feature within full scope.
